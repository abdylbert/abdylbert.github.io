This wonderful pulled chicken has the perfect balance of seasoning with a hint of Alabama BBQ. The sauce is not overly powerful but you can always add more or leave it off and still have a great tasting pulled chicken for sandwiches or plain. I searched and searched for an easy slow cooker pulled chicken recipe that would be similar to a popular BBQ restaurant. I never found one, so here's my own recipe. My family of six loves this. Keep remaining sauce refrigerated until ready to serve. Great to spread on sandwich, lettuce leaf, or drizzle over chicken on plate. <span> By</span> <span> Cara</span> <span> Honeyed Apple Cake</span> <h3> Honeyed Apple Cake </h3> <span> Rating: 3.75 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 1 </span> A lovely cake with chunks of apples flavored with honey, coffee and grated lemon rind. <span> By</span> <span> Carol</span> <span> Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp and Pineapple Skewers</span> <h3> Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp and Pineapple Skewers </h3> <span> Rating: 4.54 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 49 </span> These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21-25 per pound), however use what you have on hand. <span> By</span> <span> France C</span> <span> Irresistible Whole Wheat Challah</span> <h3> Irresistible Whole Wheat Challah </h3> <span> Rating: 4.54 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 62 </span> Warm and light, fresh out of the oven with butter and salt sprinkled on top, it is a delicious gift or dessert for any occasion. Best with whole wheat, but just white flour or a mixture works. It is easy and fun, but takes all day. Trust me, it is so worth it! <span> By</span> <span> HopelessFanatic</span> <span> Sponsored By MyPlate</span> <span> Mini Peach Cobbler</span> <h3> Mini Peach Cobbler </h3> This peach cobbler recipe is quick to make and is so quaint in the little ramekins.

They're not as heavy and dense as bagels and they have a savory filling, that combined with the chewy, light dough is absolutely magical!

So dishes that are stuffed with things like ricotta turn me off. I created this dish as a compromise to my cheese avoidance and my husband's love of Italian food. Serve this with garlic bread and a salad for a wonderful family dinner. <span> By</span> <span> RainbowJewels</span> <span> Crispy Breaded Pork Chops</span> <h3> Crispy Breaded Pork Chops </h3> With a salty, flavorful crust and juicy, tender meat in the center, these crispy breaded pork chops remind me of my grandmother's… so simple, yet so delicious!

I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! Tonic water can be substituted instead of the soda water but the taste is different and somewhat bitter. <span> By</span> <span> Brandy</span> <span> plain sugar cookies with crackled tops on a wire cooling rack</span> <span> </span> <h3> Easy Sugar Cookies </h3> <span> Rating: 4.47 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 6276 </span> Quick and easy sugar cookies!
