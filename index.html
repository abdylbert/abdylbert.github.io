I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! Tonic water can be substituted instead of the soda water but the taste is different and somewhat bitter. <span> By</span> <span> Brandy</span> <span> The Secret to Fluffy Scrambled Eggs</span> <h3> The Secret to Fluffy Scrambled Eggs </h3> In search of tender, fluffy scrambled eggs?

Loved by all. Use fresh Georgia peaches, of course! <span> By</span> <span> aeposey</span> <span> Waffles I</span> <span> </span> <h3> Waffles I </h3> <span> Rating: 4.5 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 3654 </span> You can keep the batter covered in the fridge for up to a week.
