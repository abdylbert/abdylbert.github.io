No problem. These juicy Boneless Pork Ribs are so tender they fall apart, and the only thing better than the meat is the slightly sweet, tart, and smoky sauce. We&rsquo;ve hit all the flavors you&rsquo;re looking for in barbecue, resulting in a combination of tastes that&rsquo;s juuuuuust right for a backyard cookout or family dinner. Be sure to get boneless country style ribs for this recipe. You can ask your butcher to cut a boneless pork shoulder into 1 1/2 inch-thick slabs. The process requires that you bake the ribs covered in the beginning, to retain the juice that are released from the meat, and uncovered at the end to give them a nice exterior texture and lots of texture. Serve with your favorite comfort-style side, like potato salad, cole slaw, macaroni and cheese, or grilled veggies. <span> By</span> <span> Karen Rankin</span> <span> One Pan Jambalaya</span> <h3> One-Pan Jambalaya </h3> <span> Rating: 4 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 1 </span> Andouille, a smoky, garlicky pork sausage, adds depth, but you can use any flavorful chicken or pork sausage. <span> By</span> <span> Emily Nabors Hall</span> <span> mr - Warm Cinnamon Apples reshoot</span> <span> </span> <h3> Warm Cinnamon Apples </h3> <span> Rating: 5 stars</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> 15 </span> This simple spiced apples recipe is perfect for so many applications. The tender, brown sugar-sweetened fruit slices are great served at breakfast, make for a warm and tasty side dish (especially for kiddos), are the ideal flavor complement spooned over pork chops or a pork loin, and are an amazing seasonal addition to a bowl of vanilla ice cream.
